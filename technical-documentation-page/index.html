    <header>Introduction to Regular Expressions in JavaScript</header>
    <p>Regular expressions are special strings that represent a search pattern.
    Also known as "regex" or "regexp", they help programmers match, search, and replace text.
    Regular expressions can appear cryptic because a few characters have special meaning.
    The goal is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you want, but only what you want.
    This section will cover the characters, a few shortcuts, and the common uses for writing regular expressions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Using_the_Test_Method_and_Matching_Literal_Strings">
    <header>Using the Test Method and Matching Literal Strings</header>
    <p>Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings.
    You create patterns to help you do that matching.
    If you want to find the word <code>"the"</code> in the string <code>"The dog chased the cat"</code>,
    you could use the following regular expression: <code>/the/</code>.
    Notice that quote marks are not required within the regular expression.
    JavaScript has multiple ways to use regexes.
    One way to test a regex is using the <code>.test()</code> method.
    The <code>.test()</code> method takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses),
    and returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> if your pattern finds something or not.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Match_a_Literal_String_with_Different_Possibilities">
    <header>Match a Literal String with Different Possibilities</header>
    <p>Using regexes like <code>/coding/</code>, you can look for the pattern <code>"coding"</code> in another string.
    This is powerful to search single strings, but it's limited to only one pattern.
    You can search for multiple patterns using the <code>alternation</code> or <code>OR</code> operator: <code>|</code>.
    This operator matches patterns either before or after it.
    For example, if you wanted to match <code>"yes"</code> or <code>"no"</code>, the regex you want is <code>/yes|no/</code>.
    You can also search for more than just two patterns.
    You can do this by adding more patterns with more <code>OR</code> operators separating them, like <code>/yes|no|maybe/</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Ignore_Case_While_Matching">
    <header>Ignore Case While Matching</header>
    <p>Up until now, you've looked at regexes to do literal matches of strings.
    But sometimes, you might want to also match case differences.
    Case (or sometimes letter case) is the difference between uppercase letters and lowercase letters.
    Examples of uppercase are <code>"A"</code>, <code>"B"</code>, and <code>"C"</code>.
    Examples of lowercase are <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code>, and <code>"c"</code>.
    You can match both cases using what is called a flag.
    There are other flags but here you'll focus on the flag that ignores case - the <code>i</code> flag.
    You can use it by appending it to the regex. An example of using this flag is <code>/ignorecase/i</code>.
    This regex can match the strings <code>"ignorecase"</code>, <code>"igNoreCase"</code>, and <code>"IgnoreCase"</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Extract_Matches">
    <header>Extract Matches</header>
    <p>You can also extract the actual matches you found with the <code>.match()</code> method.
    To use the <code>.match()</code> method, apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parentheses.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Find_More_Than_the_First_Match">
    <header>Find More Than the First Match</header>
    <p>So far, you have only been able to extract or search a pattern once.
    To search or extract a pattern more than once, you can use the <code>g</code> flag.
    You can have multiple flags on your regex like <code>/search/gi</code></p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Match_Anything_with_Wildcard_Period">
    <header>Match Anything with Wildcard Period</header>
    <p>Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the exact characters in your patterns.
    Thinking of all words that match, say, a misspelling would take a long time.
    Luckily, you can save time using the wildcard character: <code>.</code><br><br>
    The wildcard character <code>.</code> will match any one character.
    The wildcard is also called <code>dot</code> and <code>period</code>.
    You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex.
    For example, if you wanted to match <code>"hug"</code>, <code>"huh"</code>, <code>"hut"</code>, and <code>"hum"</code>, you can use the regex <code>/hu./</code> to match all four words.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Match_Single_Character_with_Multiple_Possibilities">
    <header>Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities</header>
    <p>You learned how to match literal patterns (<code>/literal/</code>) and wildcard character (<code>/./</code>).
        Those are the extremes of regular expressions, where one finds exact matches and the other matches everything.
        There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.
        You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes.
        Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>) brackets.
        For example, you want to match <code>"bag"</code>, <code>"big"</code>, and <code>"bug"</code> but not <code>"bog"</code>.
        You can create the regex <code>/b[aiu]g/</code> to do this.
        The <code>[aiu]</code> is the character class that will only match the characters <code>"a"</code>, <code>"i"</code>, or <code>"u"</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Match_Letters_of_the_Alphabet">
        <header>Match Letters of the Alphabet</header>
        <p>You saw how you can use <em>character sets</em> to specify a group of characters to match, but that's a lot of typing when you need to match a large range of characters (for example, every letter in the alphabet).
        Fortunately, there is a built-in feature that makes this short and simple.
        Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: <code>-</code>.
        For example, to match lowercase letters <code>a</code> through <code>e</code> you would use <code>[a-e]</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Match_Numbers_and_Letters_of_the_Alphabet">
    <header>Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet</header>
    <p>Using the hyphen (<code>-</code>) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters.
        It also works to match a range of numbers.
        For example, <code>/[0-5]/</code> matches any number between <code>0</code> and <code>5</code>, including the <code>0</code> and <code>5</code>.
        Also, it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set, as in the regex <code>/[a-z0-9]/ig</code>.</p>
